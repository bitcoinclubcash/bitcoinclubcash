[Lyokocoin ABC](https://www.lyokocoinabc.org)
===========

The goal of Lyokocoin ABC is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in
the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

What is Lyokocoin Cash?
---------------------

[Lyokocoin Cash](https://www.lyokocoincash.org/) is an experimental digital
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Lyokocoin Cash is a descendant of Lyokocoin. It became a separate currency from
the version supported by Lyokocoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017.
Lyokocoin Cash and the Lyokocoin Core version of Lyokocoin share the same
transaction history up until the split.

What is Lyokocoin ABC?
--------------------

Lyokocoin Cash. It is a fork of the [Lyokocoin Core](https://lyokocoincore.org)
software project.
